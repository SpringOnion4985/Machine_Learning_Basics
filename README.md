# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project implements a diabetes prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model is built using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Database and utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a person is diabetic based on various health metrics.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a predictive system that can help in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes. By analyzing health-related data, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Files

- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction functionalities.
